This program is for creating Casualties table out three years data. It needed some data preparation. Because, in three years given data some of the coloumns were present in some year data where in others year's not.
In casualities_2014 Casualty_IMD_Decile field and in casualities_2013 Age_of_Casualty and Casualty_IMD_Decile not present as casualities_2015 has this field

Thus, needed to make some adding and deleteion of columns to make a uniform table. Also while adding colums, we filled up with some input which will not affect the analysis.
