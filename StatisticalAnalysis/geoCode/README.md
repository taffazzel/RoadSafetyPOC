As per our data, we were not given the name of the city. Thus, we had to have name of the cities to get meaningful insight. 
In order to do that, 
* We create a database in mysql.
* Imported the CSV to database.
* Executed the program. This program uses lattitude and longitude for reverse geocoding and get the name of cities(like Birmingham,Kensington etc)
* we put the name of the cities for the correspondent field. 
* We exported the table as a CSV.
